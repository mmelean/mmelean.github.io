/*
* FUNCTIONS: 
*
*/

// 1. The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
// 2. What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
// 3. What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
// 4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
// 5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
// 6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
// 7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. 
//   If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures!
